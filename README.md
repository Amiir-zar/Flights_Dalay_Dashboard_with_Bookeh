#### Description
The Flights_Delay_Dashboard_with_Bokeh project involved creating an interactive dashboard using the Bokeh library to visualize and analyze flight delay data. The dashboard allowed users to explore patterns and trends in flight delays, including factors such as airline and delay time. Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to leverage Bokeh's features and functionality to create a visually appealing and user-friendly dashboard that effectively presents and analyzes flight delay data.
